            <strong><a href="https://www.abcfws.com/about-whiskey" target="_blank" title="Whiskey에 대해서 더 자세하게..">Whiskey</a></strong> is a type of <u>liquor</u> made from fermented grain mash. <br>
            Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat.<br>
            Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically made of charred white oak. <br>
            Uncharred white oak casks previously used for the aging of port, rum or sherry are also sometimes used.
